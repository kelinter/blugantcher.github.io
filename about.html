          Hi, I'm Blu Gantcher, a Creative Writing major at Bucknell University (Class of 2026).
          I love writing fiction, essays, and literary journalism, and I'm especially drawn to stories
          that explore identity, memory, and the everyday details of life. Through workshops, editing,
          and reporting, I'm building a career that lives at the intersection of creative writing,
          journalism, and community.

        <h2>Beyond the Page</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not writing or editing, you can usually find me watching movies at the campus theatre, 
          reading something new, or getting outside to climb, hike, or just move. 
          Creative work is how I process the world, everything from a great film scene to a conversation with friends
          eventually finds its way into my stories and essays.

          <p class="image-caption">
            I love how creative communities make space for different voices and stories.
            That sense of connection and curiosity is at the heart of everything I write.

          I'm excited to keep growing as a writer, editor, and literary community member. 
          In the next few years, I hope to continue working with literary magazines, pursue opportunities in publishing
          or journalism, and keep developing my own fiction and essays with a goal toward eventual publication.
